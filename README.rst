#Tasktimer

Tasktimer is a personal project. It is a command line application that manages tasks and times tasks. There are a bunch of command line task management projects out there, like taskwarrior for example, but there is a ton of functionality to that application that I don't actually use in the day to day, and I wanted to implement some of my own features. In particular, I like to be able to organize my day directly, and I like to estimate how long a task will take and compare that estimate to how long it really takes, in order to improve my work ethic and hold myself accountable for procrastination and/or overly optimistic estimates. 

This is a work in progress, and it could very well be broken at the time you're reading this. It's the first complete project I've written in Python, so I'm sure there's a lot of room for improvement. But so far, it works for me!
